# Cybersecurity Project2 Red vs Blue

The project consists of working on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which we played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, we attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, we used Kibana to review logs taken during the Day 1 engagement. We used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.
Then, we interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that we've successfully performed.
